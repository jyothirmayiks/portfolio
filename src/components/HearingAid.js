        This project showcases a compact hearing aid using the IC741 Opamp. It
        is designed to fit into a matchbox-sized container, utilizing minimal
        components while delivering effective functionality. Additionally, the
        device can act as a baby-phone by substituting an earphone with a
        speaker.
